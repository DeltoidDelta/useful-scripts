# Simdol's Useful Scripts

Instead of performing the tasks day by day, I've decided to program some scripts in bash / shell to lower the workload and spend time more efficiently. Or sometimes, I didn't want to perform same tasks over multiple Linux GNU / nix based systems. These scripts are highly experimental, and I am not responsible for whatever the outcome may be. That said, the scripts uploaded here are tested and used by myself and I only commit to upload the script that works.

# Documentation

Few things to note in mind:

- Be sure to have at least some bash / shell experience before using the script!
- *Always* read script's README.md as well as the script itself!
- Be sure to ask or file an issue if you need help or if the script is not working as it is intended to be.
